## Access

Admins sign in on Keycloak (client `admin-portal`). Only accounts with the **ADMIN** realm
role get in; anyone else sees *Access denied*. The services check the role again on every
`/api/admin/**` call, so the portal's check is for convenience, not security.

Local demo admin: `admin@credpay.local` / `Admin@123`

To make another account an admin: Keycloak admin console (http://localhost:8081/admin,
`admin` / `admin`) → realm **credpay** → Users → the user → Role mapping → Assign role → `ADMIN`.

## Run

```powershell
Copy-Item .env.example .env   # first time only
npm ci --no-audit --no-fund   # first time only
npm run dev
```

user-service (8080), payment-service (8000) and Keycloak (8081) must be running -
or start everything with `.\scripts\start-all.ps1` from the repo root.
